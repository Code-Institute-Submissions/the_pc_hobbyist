        The PC Hobbyist is a free to use service and we currently
        do not have any plans to start charging users for the use of the
        site, or to cover the running costs with advertising.
    </p>
    <p>
        However with all sites, it is not free to run, with you valuable
        donations we can keep the site free for everyone. This also means
        that in the future we may be able to implement newer features.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are only asking for a small donation of Â£5.00 to ensure that we
        keep the site running smoothly and without advertising. Please use
        the form below to submit your donation.
    </p>
    <p>
        All donations are appreciated, so thank you in advance and thank you
        for supporting our site!
