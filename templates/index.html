        Hello and welcome to the site!
    </p>
    <p>
        My name is Liam and I created this site for the purpose of bringing all PC
        enthusiasts from around the globe together and build a community. So whether your
        a newbie or pro there's something here for everyone!
        <br>
        I remember when I first started out building a PC there wasn't a central website or community
        that I could join in order to get help or show off any of the builds I had done so I hope this helps
        anyone out there that is just starting and also proves a useful tool for experienced users as well.
        <br>
        If you want to know more about me then I suggest you check out the <a href="/pages/about/">about page.</a>
    </p>

        To start using the site please register. Once registered, check out the blog or the forum and make yourself
        at home.
        <br>
        I hope you enjoy using the site and I welcome feedback so make sure to send me an email using the
        <a href="{% url 'contact_form' %} ">contact form.</a>
