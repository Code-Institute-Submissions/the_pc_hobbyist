## Overview

### What and Who is this website for?

This is my Stream Three project for [Code Institute](https://www.codeinstitute.net/). The project scope is to website using both the front end and back end technologies learnt throughout the entire course.

## UX

The idea is that the website will be used by PC enthusiasts of all levels from beginner to expert. The website will be mainly used as a place for PC enthusiasts to build a community where newbies can get help on building computers/problems and experts can provide their knowledge as well as blog about any current projects they are working on or anything they feel worthy of sharing with the websites community.

### Actions the personas may carryout

- As a computer enthusiast/builder, I want to create a blog and share my computer building experience as the builds progress.
- As a computer enthusiast/builder, I want to have a place where I can get Q&A on computers in general as well as any difficulties Iâ€™m having with my computer.
- As a computer enthusiast/builder, I want to be able to support the website by donating to the creators.
- As a computer enthusiast/builder, I want the ability to have a profile on the site.
- As a computer enthusiast/builder, I want an easy way to log in and out of the website.

### Mockups

I also created some mockups of the site which can be viewed in the folder named 'mockups' of this GitHub repository.

## Features

### Existing Features

None at present

### Features left to implement

- Authentication mechanism.
- E-commerce functionality
- SQL database connection using Django's ORM
- Responsive UI
- Disqus Integration
- Blog functionality
- Forum functionality

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
  - This provides the basic layout for the pages.
- CSS3
  - I have used some custom css to build on top the styling provided by Bootstrap.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
  - I have used bootstrap to give my website a clean and responsive layout.
- JavaScript
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
  - I have used the Django framework to build this website as using a framework provides several advantages such as:
    - Frameworks reduce time and effort acquired from common and repetitive tasks.
    - Django incorporates the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) philosophy.
    - Frameworks speed up development.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
  - Used to deploy and host the dashboard.
- [gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/)
  - Used for running HTTP servers on UNIX based operating systems as Heroku uses Ubuntu Server.
- [ClearDB MySQL](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/cleardb)
  - I used ClearDB MySql to host my database on Heroku.
- flatpages app
    - I used flatpages for my about page.
- [Amazon AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/)
    - I used an AWS s3 bucket to host my static files and user uploaded images as I ran into difficulties with Heroku.

## Testing

Not yet started.

## Deployment

For this project I deployed the code to Heroku using the steps below.

### Separated Online code from Offline code

So to begin with I created a new settings directory at the root of the project. This directory holds 4 files:
-  `__init__.py`: This is an empty file that informs Python that the directory should be considered a Python package.
-  `base.py`: This file contains our base settings
-  `dev.py`: This imports the base settings and adds settings for the development environment.
-  `staging.py`: This imports the base settings and adds settings for the staging environment.

I then went on to create the necessary requirements files placing them in a new directory called requirements. I also added a requirements.txt to the project
for deployment to Heroku.

### Setting up Heroku

1. I headed over to Heroku and set up a new app called "the-pc-hobbyist". 
2. Once that was completed I updated my `staging.py` settings to include the app url.
3. I added gunicorn to my `requirements/base.txt`.
4. I ran `pip install -r requirements/dev.txt` to make sure that all of the development dependencies were installed.
5. I created a new file called Procfile and added `web: gunicorn stream3_prj.wsgi:application`.
6. I created a runtime.txt file and added `python-2.7.15`.
7. I then created a Procfile.local and added `web: gunicorn stream3_prj.wsgi:application`.
8. Then I ran the following command in Bash: `export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=settings.dev`
9. Then I ran `heroku local -f Procfile.local` to test that I could still see the website on localhost.
10. I then pushed my changes to GitHub, connected Heroku to Github as the deployment method and enbaled automatic deploys.
11. From the command line, I logged into Heroku and ran the following commands:
    1.  `heroku config:set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=settings.staging --app the-pc-hobbyist` to set the environment on Heroku.
    2.  `heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app YOUR_HEROKU_APP` to prevent static collection.
    3.  `heroku ps:scale web=1 --app YOUR_HEROKU_APP` to start my dyno.
12. I was then able to run `heroku open --app the-pc-hobbyist` and see the project open in my browser.

### Hosting the MySQL database

To host he MySQL database I did the following:

1. On heroku I provisioned ClearDB MySQL. Once provisioned I deleted `reconnect=true` from the `CLEARDB_DATABASE_URL` config variables.
2. I then added `dj-database-url==0.2.1` to requirements/staging.txt and updated the settings/staging.py for my `DATABASES` setting.
3. From the command line I then logged into Heroku and ran the following command to run migrations and generate the tables: `heroku run --app the-pc-hobbyist python manage.py migrate --settings=settings.staging`.
4. Then to populat the database I ran this command to dump the data from the local database into a json file: `python manage.py dumpdata --natural-foreign -e contenttypes -e auth.Permission --indent=4 > db.json --settings=settings.dev`.
5. Once that was completed I pushed the newly created `db.json` file up to GitHub and ran this command `heroku run --app the-pc-hobbyist python manage.py loaddata db.json --settings=settings.staging` to load the data into the hosted database.

### Static files

In order to organise my static files I carried out the following steps:

1. I added `whitenoise==3.2` to requirements/base.txt and ran `pip install -r requirements/base.txt` to install it.
2. I then altered the `wsgi.py` file to use `whitenoise`.
3. Finally I ran the following from the command line: `heroku config:unset DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app the-pc-hobbyist` so that on the next build Heroku will run the `collectstatic` command.
