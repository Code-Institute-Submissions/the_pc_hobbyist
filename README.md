## Technologies Used

- HTML5

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
  - I have used bootstrap to give my website a clean and responsive layout.
- JavaScript
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
  - I have used the Django framework to build this website as using a framework provides several advantages such as:
    - Frameworks reduce time and effort acquired from common and repetitive tasks.
    - Django incorporates the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) philosophy.
    - Frameworks speed up development.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
  - Used to deploy and host the dashboard.
- [gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/)
  - Used for running HTTP servers on UNIX based operating systems as Heroku uses Ubuntu Server.
- [ClearDB MySQL](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/cleardb)
  - I used ClearDB MySql to host my database on Heroku.
