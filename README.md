## Overview

### What and Who is this website for?

This is my Stream Three project for [Code Institute](https://www.codeinstitute.net/). The project scope is to website using both the front end and back end technologies learnt throughout the entire course.

## UX

The idea is that the website will be used by PC enthusiasts of all levels from beginner to expert. The website will be mainly used as a place for PC enthusiasts to build a community where newbies can get help on building computers/problems and experts can provide their knowledge as well as blog about any current projects they are working on or anything they feel worthy of sharing with the websites community.

### Actions the personas may carryout

- As a computer enthusiast/builder, I want to create a blog and share my computer building experience as the builds progress.
- As a computer enthusiast/builder, I want to have a place where I can get Q&A on computers in general as well as any difficulties Iâ€™m having with my computer.
- As a computer enthusiast/builder, I want to be able to support the website by donating to the creators.
- As a computer enthusiast/builder, I want the ability to have a profile on the site.
- As a computer enthusiast/builder, I want an easy way to log in and out of the website.

### Mockups

I also created some mockups of the site which can be viewed in the folder named 'mockups' of this GitHub repository.

## Features

### Existing Features

None at present

### Features left to implement

- Authentication mechanism.
- E-commerce functionality
- SQL database connection using Django's ORM
- Responsive UI
- Disqus Integration
- Blog functionality
- Forum functionality

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
  - This provides the basic layout for the pages.
- CSS3
  - I have used some custom css to build on top the styling provided by Bootstrap.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
  - I have used bootstrap to give my website a clean and responsive layout.
- JavaScript
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
  - I have used the Django framework to build this website as using a framework provides several advantages such as:
    - Frameworks reduce time and effort acquired from common and repetitive tasks.
    - Django incorporates the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) philosophy.
    - Frameworks speed up development.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
  - Used to deploy and host the dashboard.
- [gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/)
  - Used for running HTTP servers on UNIX based operating systems as Heroku uses Ubuntu Server.
- [ClearDB MySQL](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/cleardb)
  - I used ClearDB MySql to host my database on Heroku.

## Testing

Not yet started.

## Deployment

For this project I deployed the code to Heroku using the steps below.

### Separated Online code from Offline code

So to begin with I created a new settings directory at the root of the project. This directory holds 4 files:
-  `__init__.py`: This is an empty file that informs Python that the directory should be considered a Python package.
-  `base.py`: This file contains our base settings
-  `dev.py`: This imports the base settings and adds settings for the development environment.
-  `staging.py`: This imports the base settings and adds settings for the staging environment.

I then went on to create the necessary requirements files placing them in a new directory called requirements. I also added a requirements.txt to the project
for deployment to Heroku.

### Setting up Heroku

1. I headed over to Heroku and set up a new app called "the-pc-hobbyist". 
2. Once that was completed I updated my `staging.py` settings to include the app url.
3. I added gunicorn to my `requirements/base.txt`.
4. I ran `pip install -r requirements/dev.txt` to make sure that all of the development dependencies were installed.
5. I created a new file called Procfile and added `web: gunicorn stream3_prj.wsgi:application`.
6. I created a runtime.txt file and added `python-2.7.15`.
7. I then created a Procfile.local and added `web: gunicorn stream3_prj.wsgi:application`.
8. Then I ran the following command in Bash: `export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=settings.dev`
9. Then I ran `heroku local -f Procfile.local` to test that I could still see the website on localhost.
